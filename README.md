Guess Massachusetts Towns
=========================

Because I need to learn my way around here.

How to play
-----------

1. Given a town name, pick a boundary from an unlabeled map.
2. Try again.
3. Get better at this.

Local dev
---------

Clone, install, make.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:eyeseast/guess-mass.git
npm install
make data/towns.json
```

And serve:

```bash
npm start
```

Or build javascript files and serve another way:

```bash
npm run build
serve .
```
